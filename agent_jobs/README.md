# Agent Job Summaries

This directory stores markdown records of completed automation tasks.
Each file should include:
- **Job description** referencing the issue file.
- **Agent prompts** used to perform the job.
- **Diff summary** of repository changes.
- **Paths to any generated outputs** such as build artifacts.

Use sequential numbering when creating new summary files, e.g., `001_initial_setup.md`.
