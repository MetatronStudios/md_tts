# 001: Project Setup

## Goal
Establish the base project structure for the Markdown Text-to-Speech Reader.

## Tasks
- Initialize a Git repository (already done).
- Set up a Vue 3 project using Vite in a `frontend/` directory.
- Configure Prettier and ESLint for JavaScript formatting and linting.
- Set up a Python virtual environment and create a `backend/` directory with a basic Flask app skeleton.
- Configure black and flake8 for Python code style checks.
- Provide initial README instructions to run frontend and backend dev servers.

## Completion
The task is complete when both the frontend and backend directories contain minimal working projects that start with `npm run dev` and `flask run`.
