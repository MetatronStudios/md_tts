# Issue: Marked Word Out of Sync with Spoken Audio

## Description
The marked word displayed during playback is out of sync with the spoken audio. This issue affects the user experience by causing confusion between the visual and auditory cues.

## Proposed Solution
1. **Investigate Timing Mismatch**:
   - Analyze the timing data generated by the `PiperWrapper` class.
   - Check if the timings provided for each word are accurate.

2. **Adjust Playback Logic**:
   - Ensure the playback logic aligns the marked word with the audio.
   - Implement a mechanism to handle timing discrepancies.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test the synchronization with various text inputs and playback speeds.
   - Verify that the marked word matches the spoken audio.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The marked word should be in sync with the spoken audio during playback.
- The synchronization should work for different text inputs and playback speeds.
- The issue should be reproducible and resolved.

## Tasks
- Investigate the cause of the timing mismatch.
- Update the playback logic to ensure synchronization.
- Test the synchronization with various scenarios.
- Update documentation to reflect the changes.
