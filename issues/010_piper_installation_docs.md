# Issue: Missing Documentation for Installing and Setting Up Piper TTS

## Description
The project currently lacks documentation on how to install Piper TTS, configure it with an example voice, and set it up to ensure proper functionality with the `PiperWrapper` class.

## Proposed Solution
1. **Installation Instructions**:
   - Provide step-by-step instructions for installing Piper TTS.
   - Include details on downloading and installing an example voice.

2. **Setup Guide**:
   - Explain how to configure Piper TTS to work with the `PiperWrapper` class.
   - Include troubleshooting tips for common issues.

3. **Documentation Location**:
   - Add the installation and setup guide to the `README.md` file in the `backend` folder.
   - Optionally, create a separate `INSTALL.md` file for detailed instructions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The documentation should include clear and concise steps for installing Piper TTS.
- The setup guide should ensure users can configure Piper TTS to work with the project.
- Example commands and configurations should be provided.
- Troubleshooting tips should cover common issues like missing dependencies or incorrect paths.

## Tasks
- Write installation instructions for Piper TTS.
- Add an example voice setup guide.
- Update the `README.md` file or create a new `INSTALL.md` file.
- Verify the instructions by testing the setup process.
